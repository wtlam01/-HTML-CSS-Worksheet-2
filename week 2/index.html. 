    <h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratcg?</h1>
    <h2>Yeah, but have you really thought about it?</h2>
    <h3>Like, how if you put the sauce on first, before you make the base it doesn't work?</h3>
    <h4>Or, if you put the cheese on then the sauce it's messed up too<h/4>

    <p>Making a pizza is simlar to coding. There are certain things we have to do first. Like making the base, letting it rise, mould the base out...<p/>

    <ol>
       <li>make the pizza base</li>
       <li>add the tomato sauce</li>
       <li>add the toppings</li>
       <li>add the chese</li>
       <li>bake</li>
       <li>cut<em>(only if you are crazy>)</em></li>
       <li>serve</li>
   </ol>

   <p>Here's is the <a href="https://en.wilipedia.org/wiki/Pizza"Wikipedia article about pizza.</a></p>
